# flash_card
A game to improve language skills

- This game replicates using flash cards to revise a language, in this case French to English
- UI is created using tkinter package
- The French word appears on the flashcard, and a few seconds later the English translation replaces the French word
- If the user got the answer right, they press the tick and the word will not appear again; if they get it wrong, they press the X and the word will reappear
